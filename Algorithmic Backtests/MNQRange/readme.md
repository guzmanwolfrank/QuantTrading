# Project Overview

This project analyzes Micro E-mini NASDAQ-100 Futures (MNQ) using Python libraries such as `yfinance`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`. It includes data retrieval, preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Data Description

The data consists of intraday and historical price information for MNQ fetched using the `yfinance` library. Intraday data covers the last 60 days with 15-minute intervals, while historical data spans one year.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze intraday and historical price data for MNQ.
- Calculate summary statistics and rolling averages for specific time intervals.
- Visualize trends and rolling averages using line plots.
- Predict future closing prices using linear regression.

## Project Deliverables

The project delivers:

- Insights into intraday and historical price movements for MNQ.
- Visualizations depicting trends and rolling averages.
- Predicted closing prices for the next ten days.

## Goals

- Gain insights into MNQ price movements during specific time intervals.
- Understand the relationship between different price metrics and rolling averages.
- Predict future closing prices for MNQ using linear regression.

## Initial Questions

1. What are the average opening ranges for different windows of days?
2. What percentage of the day range is the open-only range?
3. How do rolling averages compare across different columns and window sizes?

## Findings

- Average opening ranges for different window sizes show variations over time.
- The percentage of the day range represented by the open-only range varies across instances.
- Rolling averages highlight trends and fluctuations in absolute day change, open-only range, and day range.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into MNQ price dynamics, enabling better understanding and prediction of future price movements. By leveraging intraday and historical data, along with advanced analytics techniques, this project enhances decision-making in trading and investment strategies.
