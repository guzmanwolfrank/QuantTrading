# EUR/USD Trading Strategy Backtest

## Project Overview

This project implements and backtests a simple trading strategy for the EUR/USD currency pair. The core idea is to capitalize on potential upward momentum by entering long positions when the market opens higher than the previous day's close.

Key aspects of the strategy:
- Entry Condition: Buy when the opening price is above the previous day's closing price
- Risk Management: 20 pip stop-loss to limit potential losses
- Profit Target: 45 pip take-profit to secure gains

The backtest analyzes historical data to evaluate the strategy's performance over time. It provides insights into the strategy's profitability, risk, and overall effectiveness in various market conditions.

This project serves as a starting point for forex algorithmic trading research and can be extended with more sophisticated indicators, machine learning models, or alternative data sources.

## Features

- Fetches historical EUR/USD data using yfinance
- Implements a basic trading strategy
- Performs backtesting with specified stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Generates a performance report using quantstats
- Saves trade data to a CSV file

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance
- quantstats






The script will:
1. Download historical EUR/USD data
2. Perform the backtest
3. Generate a performance report (HTML)
4. Save trade data (CSV)
5. Print summary statistics

## Output

The script generates two output files:

1. `eur_usd_backtest_report.html`: A comprehensive performance report generated by quantstats.
2. `eur_usd_trades.csv`: A CSV file containing details of all trades executed during the backtest.

The console output will display:
- Final balance
- Total return
- Number of trades
- File paths for the generated output files

You can modify the following parameters in the script:

- `start_date` and `end_date`: To change the backtest period
- `initial_balance`: To set a different starting balance
- Stop-loss and take-profit levels (currently set to 20 and 45 pips respectively)
