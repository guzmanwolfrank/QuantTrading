#  Quant Trading
A collection of algorithmic backtests and trading tools written in python.

N.B.:  All backtests are simple and simply looking for return criteria to be fulfilled.  Complex orders, size parlays, and defined stops are calculated in algorithm for deployment. 
All backtests so far are using Open as the Entry and Close as the exit as long as the signal is triggered or present.  
Add slippage and look at the average open range in order to simulate entering a market order at the open after the signal is present.  By analyzing the range of the first 2 minutes of trading, one can estimate the slippage on entry price off this system. 
**Work in progress
