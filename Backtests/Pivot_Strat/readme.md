# Project Overview 

This project creates an algorithm based on the [EURUSD Pivot Strategy backtest](https://github.com/guzmanwolfrank/QuantTrading/tree/main/Backtests/Pivot_Strat). 
The main signal is generated depending on the price of the close relative to the intraday pivot point.

This bot is designed for use on OANDA FX brokerage API.

# Data Description

This section describes the key columns within the dataset used by the EURUSD Pivot Strategy algorithm.

### Price Data:

Open: The opening price of the EURUSD currency pair for a given period. <br/>
High: The highest price reached by EURUSD during that period.<br/>
Low: The lowest price reached by EURUSD during that period.<br/>
Close: The price at which EURUSD closed for the period. This price is used by the algorithm to determine the main signal based on its proximity to the pivot point.<br/>
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, taking into account dividend distributions and stock splits.<br/>

### Pivot Points:
PP: The pivot point, calculated as the average of the previous day's high, low, and close prices.<br/>
R1: The first resistance level, typically calculated as 1.5 times the distance between the PP and the S1 level, added to the PP.<br/>
S1: The first support level, typically calculated as 1.5 times the distance between the PP and the R1 level, subtracted from the PP.<br/>

### Algorithm-Specific Data:
Signal: The buy or sell signal generated by the algorithm based on the Close price relative to the PP and potentially other technical indicators.<br/>
Returns: The percentage return on each trade executed by the algorithm.<br/>
Profit: The cumulative profit or loss generated by the algorithm over a given period.<br/>
Balance: The total account balance after each trade, reflecting the cumulative performance of the algorithm.<br/>


## Project Objectives 


To develop and implement an automated trading algorithm on the OANDA FX brokerage platform, utilizing the EURUSD Pivot Strategy to generate buy and sell signals based on the price of the close relative to the intraday pivot point.

# Goals

Successful Algorithm Implementation.
Seamlessly integrate the algorithm with the OANDA FX brokerage API.
Ensure accurate execution of trades based on generated signals.
Implement robust error handling and risk management mechanisms.
Effective Trading Performance:

Generate consistent and profitable trading results in live market conditions.
Evaluate and optimize the algorithm's performance through backtesting and forward testing.
Fine-tune signal generation and trade execution parameters for optimal outcomes.
Comprehensive Monitoring and Analysis:

Develop a system to track and analyze the algorithm's performance in real-time.
Generate detailed performance reports, including profit and loss statements, drawdowns, win rates, and other key metrics.
Identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to the algorithm.
Continuous Evaluation and Improvement:

Regularly review and assess the algorithm's performance in response to changing market conditions.
Adapt and refine the algorithm as needed to maintain its effectiveness.
Explore potential enhancements, such as incorporating additional technical indicators or risk management strategies.

# Initial Questions 
1. Is the strategy profitable in a backtest? Does it beat the benchmark strategy?
2. What are the return metrics?  Sharpe ratio? Sortino?  Max Drawdown? 


# Exploring the Data
This section provides insights into the data exploration process, outlining key steps and visualizations generated from the historical stock market data.

### 1. Data Retrieval

#### Ticker: NQ=F (Default)
- The project retrieves historical stock market data for the E-mini Nasdaq 100 (NQ) futures contract as the default ticker.
- Users can modify the ticker by providing input during script execution.

#### Date Range: Last 30 Days
- Data is fetched with daily intervals, covering the last 30 days.

### 2. Pivot Points and Technical Levels

#### Calculation
- Pivot points, support levels (S1, S2, S3), and resistance levels (R1, R2, R3) are calculated based on traditional pivot point analysis.

#### Data Organization
- The calculated pivot points and related prices are structured into a Pandas DataFrame named `pivot_data`.

#### Last Calculated Pivot Points
- The last row of pivot points (excluding the most recent data) is extracted and printed for informational purposes.

### 3. Data Visualization

#### Line Plot
- A line plot is generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- It visualizes hypothetical daily returns for the backtest.

#### Dataframe 
- A pandas dataframe is displayed after runing the script. 
- The dataframe shows a table with Open, High, Low, and Close stock prices along with calculated pivot points, support, and resistance levels.

#### QuantStats HTML Tearsheet 
- QuantStats module prints results and risk metrics to an external webpage.  You can save it locally or to your online Github repository.
