5.  Run the program in the Jupyter notebook.  Click on the Run All button after selecting a Python 3.9 kernel.  


## Project Details

This project is intended to help a beginner start working on algorithms and backtests on simple quant strategies.  
We will be using a Forex Brokerage account as a Data Provider and its Python module as well. 

The strategy consists of buying on a signal that is triggered when the 10 day moving average is greater than the day's open. 

The transaction then occurs on the following day's open and close. 

The program will then record results into a dataframe which can then be visualized with seaborn and other python modules. 

Backtest and Transaction Details: 

        Currency Pair: EUR/USD 
#

        Account Balance: $ 10,000
        Leverage : 50X
        Average Order Size: 50,000
        Order Entry: Buy Market at Open
        Order Exit: Sell Market at Close
        Margin Used: $ 1,000
        Margin: 2%


We will run multiple iterations of the backtest through set dates in order to analyze the data and see if the strategy is worth pursuing. 


## Issues, Challenges and Solutions

Issues: 
    One of the issues faced was selecting a module that was accurate for data.  Certain other modules have unstable connections, deprecated software and are highly unavailable during peak times. 

Solution: 
The best module for this backtest on currency was oandapyv20.  Oanda is a forex broker with excellent data which is reliable, accurate and highly available for clients.  

    Another issue was simplicity.   By simplifying the code for the backtest, we can assure that the program is used by as many begginers as possible.  


Challenges:  

    Coding a strategy on basic code that executes      accurately while limiting slippage and price complexity.   

    Another challenge is downloading sufficient data while  limiting granularity in order to cap the size and latency of the data.    I wanted this to be simple, light and easy to customize.  

Solutions:  

    I figured out to limit task bloating and complexity by using a basic signal strategy. 

    We will use a simple moving average cross along with a simplified trade entry system.
