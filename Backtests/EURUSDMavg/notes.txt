For this algorithm we will not change granularity and we will not worry about stop losses or stop profits or trails
The main objective is to run a simple algorithm backtest.  We can then build a more complex version after this one is finished.
The more complex version, will serve as the backbone and template, for many others. 

For this algo, we just need drawdown analysis, buy and hold or benchmark analysis, results stats like sharpe 
and sortino.  Also, add Seaborn only visualizations. 

All thats left for a more complex, private algo backtest is granularity and stops along with figuring out what other columns you need 

        Granularity set to 15 minutes allows us to know at what time we exit, we can then change the code
